## Overview

## My process

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

```css
.card {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 #2e2c2c;
    background-color: #fff;
    max-width: 300px;
    margin: auto;
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 15px;
}

.card img {
    border: 1px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development
I'd like to continue on focusing more on CSS
Especially with positioning as I struggled in this area the most during this project

### Useful resources
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_profile_card.asp) - This helped me make the QR code/text to be formatted within a card.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp) - Managed to set the image up correctly.
